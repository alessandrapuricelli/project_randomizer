          In our current times, the competition in the graphic design field is very extreme, and designers cannot miss
          new
          possibilities. It is crucial to be able to produce new material and to show personal skills to the public.<br>
          The Random Poster Generator emerges as the perfect tool to reach this goal. By following the practical series
          of
          selections proposed by the website, it will be incredibly more straightforward for the designer to come up
          with
          a new poster to share online.<br>
          The selection of a specific time frame will also help the designer to stick to a precise timing to be faster
          and
          more productive.<br>

          By creating posters, the designer will gain points which allow to upgrade to higher levels and therefore to
          increase productivity.<br>
          The points will also be visible on the <a href="https://rpg-portfolio.tumblr.com" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Random Poster Generator Portfolio</a>, a website where all the projects
          realized by the users are collected.<br>
          The Random Poster Generator Portfolio also represents an opportunity to see what other fellow designers are
          producing.<br><br>

          *All the elements proposed to the designer are suggestions which will make the whole production process more
          natural and effective. Nevertheless, it is, of course, possible for the designer to use additional typefaces
          or colors if needed for a better final result.
